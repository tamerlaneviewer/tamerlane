> **All state is accessed and updated via the `useIIIFStore` hook.**

## üîÅ Side Effects (`useEffect` in App.tsx)

Zustand actions and state are used inside `useEffect` hooks to coordinate data fetching and UI updates.

### Effect 1 ‚Äî `[ currentManifest, selectedImageIndex, ... ]`
Sets the current `canvasId` in the store whenever the manifest or the selected image index changes.

### Effect 2 ‚Äî `[ canvasId, ... ]`
Fetches the list of annotations (`annotations`) for the current `canvasId`. 
**Key Logic**: This effect includes a cleanup function that sets a `isStale` flag. If another `canvasId` change occurs before the current annotation request finishes, the cleanup function runs, and the stale request's results are ignored, preventing race conditions.

### Effect 3 ‚Äî `[ pendingAnnotationId, annotations, viewerReady, ... ]`
**The core selection logic.** When an annotation is pending (`pendingAnnotationId` is set), this effect waits for the `annotations` to load for the correct `canvasId` and for the `viewerReady` flag to be true. It then finds the matching annotation, sets it as `selectedAnnotation`, and clears the `pendingAnnotationId`.

### Effect 4 ‚Äî `[ iiifContentUrl, ... ]`
Loads the initial manifest or collection when the `iiifContentUrl` changes. This is the main entry point for loading new content.

## üß≠ Core Logic Functions (Store Actions)

- **`handleManifestUpdate(...)`**: Updates manifest, collection, and related metadata in the store.
- **`fetchManifestByIndex(index, preserveSearchResults?)`**: Loads a manifest by its index. The optional `preserveSearchResults` flag keeps the search context when navigating between manifests from a search result.
- **`handleSearch(query)`**: Performs a content search, tags results with their parent manifest ID, and updates `searchResults` in the store.
- **`handleSearchResultClick(result)`**: The primary action for search interaction. It intelligently determines if the result is on the current canvas (for a quick selection) or a new canvas (triggering a full load), then sets the `pendingAnnotationId` to start the selection process.
- **`handleViewerReady()`**: A simple handler passed to the viewer component, which calls `setViewerReady(true)` in the store.

---

## üß© Component Interaction

- **Header**: Receives navigation, search, and language state/handlers from the store.
- **LeftPanel**: Receives manifest and collection metadata from the store.
- **MiddlePanel**: Receives image/canvas data, `selectedAnnotation`, and the `viewerReady` state. It calls `handleViewerReady` when it's done loading.
- **RightPanel**: Receives `annotations`, `searchResults`, `pendingAnnotationId`, and the active tab state from the store. It triggers selection actions.
- **UrlDialog / ErrorDialog**: Visibility is driven entirely by the `showUrlDialog` and `error` state variables in the store.
